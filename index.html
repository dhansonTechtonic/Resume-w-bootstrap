          <p>I was born and raised in beautiful Colorado alongside the Rocky Mountains. My passions are creating and solving puzzles. Ever since I was a little girl I've been doodling and "putting the correct shape in the correct hole". More specifically I enjoy drawing and painting (digitally or not), logic puzzles, chess, and playing music (such as guitar, piano, and singing). Other pasttimes I enjoy are soccer, video games, hiking, and now coding! Recently I was accepted into an apprenticeship at a tech agency 'Techtonic Group' to learn to develop software.</p>
